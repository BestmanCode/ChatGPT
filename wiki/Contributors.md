# Where to contribute:
If you know how to reverse Engineer APIs, check out [OpenAIAuth](https://github.com/acheong08/OpenAIAuth) where captcha support and error handling has yet to be perfected

If you are interested in extending this project for other features, simply create your own repository and import this library.

If you aren't a coder, you can still write some documentation for us.
