# Versions 0, 2, and 3

By using these versions, you agree to [OpenAI's privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy). This repository does not collect any data.

# Version 1

Version 1 requires a cloudflare bypass to access `chat.openai.com`. Therefore, in combination to [OpenAI's privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy), you must also accept the privacy policy of other providers involved in the process.

- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/) - The bypass server is hosted there
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) - Used to prevent abuse
- My own privacy policy

# My privacy policy

My bypass server does not contain any code to log and store data.

# Future changes

Opt in data collection will be added as an option and can be enabled if desired **by the end users**. This is part of an attempt to create a dataset for fine tuning open source LLMs towards chat functionality. It will **not** be enabled by default.

The bypass server itself will **never** log or collect your access tokens or conversations.
