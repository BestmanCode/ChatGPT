# Contributing to ChatGPT

We welcome contributions to ChatGPT! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

ChatGPT is an open-source project, and we welcome a wide range of contributions. Here are some examples of the types of contributions we are looking for:

- Code patches
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and fixes
- Feature requests and suggestions

Please note that ChatGPT is intended to be used as a development library, so contributions should stay within this scope.

## How to submit a contribution

If you would like to contribute to ChatGPT, follow these steps:

1. Fork the ChatGPT repository.
2. Create a new branch in your fork to make your changes.
3. Commit your changes to your new branch.
4. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

We will review your pull request and, if everything looks good, merge it into the main codebase.
