# V2 Fast ChatGPT API

> ## Under maintenance

Using cloudflare bypass server (no browser on server either). Check out the server source code: https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT-Proxy-V2

> ### Notices
> It seems I wasn't clear enough in my explanations and lead to some misunderstandings:
> - Your email and password are not sent to me. Authentication is done locally with https://github.com/acheong08/OpenAIAuth
>  - *Unless you use `--insecure-auth`*. This is meant for users who are blocked from accessing OpenAI websites
> - The server is open source: https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT-Proxy-V2 but with a `config.json` missing to avoid OpenAI detection.
> - Rate limits: 180 requests per minute (IP based)
> - I am running the server right now

> ## IMPORTANT
> You must either define `--paid` in command line or `paid=True` in code if you have a plus subscription.

## Usage

`pip3 install --upgrade revChatGPT`

```
 $ python3 -m revChatGPT.V2 -h
