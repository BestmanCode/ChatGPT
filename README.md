# Reversed API (Browser required)

This breaks terms of service

</summary>

## Installation
`pip3 install revChatGPT[unofficial]`

## Configuration

Refer to the setup [guide](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT/wiki/Setup) for more information.

## Usage

### Command line

`python3 -m revChatGPT`

```
!help - Show this message
!reset - Forget the current conversation
!refresh - Refresh the session authentication
!config - Show the current configuration
!rollback x - Rollback the conversation (x being the number of messages to rollback)
!exit - Exit this program
```

### API
`python3 -m GPTserver`

HTTP POST request:

```json
{
  "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiL...",
  "prompt": "Your prompt here"
}
```

Optional:

```json
{
  "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiL...",
  "prompt": "Your prompt here",
  "conversation_id": "UUID...",
  "parent_id": "UUID..."

### Developer

```python
from revChatGPT.ChatGPT import Chatbot

chatbot = Chatbot({
  "session_token": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
}, conversation_id=None, parent_id=None) # You can start a custom conversation

response = chatbot.ask("Prompt", conversation_id=None, parent_id=None) # You can specify custom conversation and parent ids. Otherwise it uses the saved conversation (yes. conversations are automatically saved)

print(response)
# {
#   "message": message,
#   "conversation_id": self.conversation_id,
#   "parent_id": self.parent_id,
# }
```
